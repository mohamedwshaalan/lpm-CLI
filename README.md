# The Linux Process Manager (or lpm)
is a rust-based command-line interface task manager implemented for linux based systems. It displays the process table with attributes, overview of the system, sorting and filtering, updating, as well as options to kill, continue, terminate, and sleep processes. Implemented with the cursive crates for a "frontend", and the sysinfo and procfs crates for a "backend", this program offers a gui flavor to a command line task manager which offers all high-end features in a simplistic, easy to navigate manner.
